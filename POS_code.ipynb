    "## POS Tagging\n",
    " This assignment will develop skills in part-of-speech (POS) tagging, the process of assigning a part-of-speech tag (Noun, Verb, Adjective...) to each word in an input text.  Tagging is difficult because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times. They are  **Ambiguous**. Let's look at the following example: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The whole team played **well**. [adverb]\n",
    "- You are doing **well** for yourself. [adjective]\n",
    "- **Well**, this assignment took me forever to complete. [interjection]\n",
    "- The **well** is dry. [noun]\n",
    "- Tears were beginning to **well** in her eyes. [verb]"

    "- The variable `z` is an array that stores the unique integer ID of the predicted POS tags for each word in the corpus.  In array z, at position 2, store the value 28 to indicate that the word 'upward' (at index 2 in the corpus), most likely has the POS tag associated with unique ID 28 (which is `RB`).\n",

Since the most likely POS tag for 'upward' is `RB`, which is uniquely identified by integer ID 28, go to the `best_paths` matrix in column 2, row 28.  The value stored in `best_paths`, column 2, row 28 indicates the unique ID of the POS tag of the previous word.  In this case, the value stored here is 40, which is the unique ID for POS tag `VBZ` (verb, 3rd person singular present).\n",
